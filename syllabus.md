**Room: 300 ASC**  

**Professor**: Dr. Matt O'Donnell  
**Email**: mbod@asc.upenn.edu  
**Office Hours**: TBA & by appointment
**Office**: 404 ASC  

## Course Description, Goals and Objectives

In this hands-on course students will learn how to manage large textual datasets (e.g. Twitter, YouTube, news stories) to investigate research questions. They will work through a series of steps to collect,
organize, analyze and present textual data by using automated tools toward a final project of relevant interest.  The course will cover linguistic theory and techniques that can be applied to textual data (particularly from the fields of corpus linguistics and natural language processing).

No prior programming experience is required. Through this course students will gain skills writing Python programs to handle large amounts of textual data and become familiar with one of the key techniques used by data scientists, which is currently one of the most in-demand jobs.

* This course will provide an introduction to Python programming for collecting, preparing and analyzing text data from various sources including
social media (e.g. Twitter), weblogs, online news media and various publicly available archives (e.g. presidential speech achive, congressional sessions).

* Each week one session will be in lecture and seminar form and provide background for the theory and techniques and the second will be a lab session
in which students will work through programming exercises using Jupyter notebooks [A web-based programming environment well suited for data science and class-based assignments].

* By completing this course students will:
	* gain an understanding of relevant linguistic concepts for the analysis of text
	* understand the field of corpus linguistics and how its concepts and tools can be applied to text analysis questions of relevance to Communication
	* be exposed to a range of techniques from natural language processing and understand how they can be used to improve content analyses
	* gain a basic level of programming proficiency in the Python programming language and have completed a number of programming exercises to build, cleanÂ and analysis corpora of text

## Textbooks and resources

* The main readings on corpus linguistics will come from:
	* Baker, P. (2006) _Using Corpora in Discourse Analysis_. London: Continuum

* and on Python programming and NLP concepts from:
	* Bird, S., Klein, E. & Loper, E. _Natural Language Processing with Python - Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit._ Updated version for Python 3. Available free online at http://www.nltk.org/book/


## Assessment

1. **Complete the assigned readings and participation in class discussion (10%)**
	* Readings for each week will be posted on Canvas when electronic versions are available or taken from one of the recommended textbooks.
2. **Attend weekly lab sessions and complete the assigned exercises (40%)**
    * Wednesday class sessions will be programming labs. Students are required to bring a laptop that can connect to the ASC network. Please contact the me if this is difficult and we can see if a machine can be made available for use in lab.
	* We will be using Jupyter notebooks to learn Python, which are a web-based interactive programming environment. Assignments will be completed in this and submitted to the instructor. Details of using this system for assignments will be covered in the first lab session.
	* Weekly assignments will be due at 5pm on the Monsday following lab session (see schedule for details). These assignments are intended to help students practice the programming concepts and structures introduced in lab and build confidence. They should not be difficult or take excessive time but they do build from week to week so it is _very_ important to keep up.
3. **Complete a project that uses the techniques and theory covered in class to carry out a text analysis of a specific research question agreed upon with the instructor (50%)**
    * The goal of this project is to create an engaging blog post similar those produced by data journalists after [State of the Union](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/01/21/the-state-of-the-union-address-in-a-single-figure/?utm_term=.1a2854849261) addresses or on a topic like ['How men and women talk about love'](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/07/upshot/modern-love-what-we-write-when-we-write-about-love.html) in the NYTimes recently.
    
    * The steps in the project are: 
         1. Decide upon a tractable research question that involves analysis of textual data, e.g.: 
            * _Did Hillary Clinton's language as candidate change between 2008 and 2016?_
            * _What makes and when is Donald Trump happy (as evidenced on Twitter)?_
            * _What characterises the online media's discussion of poverty/immigration/etc.?_
            * _From smoking to vaping - Examining online testimonials of e-cigarette users_ 
            * _Comparing portrayal of women in rap and country music__
         2. Identify, retrieve and prepare a relevant corpus, e.g. 
            * Clinton 2008 and 2016 campaign speeches 
            * Trumps tweets since 2014
            * Online news coverage of poverty/immigration/..
            * User stories from online vaping forum, etc.)
            * Representative samples of song lyrics
         3. Carry out linguistic analysis of corpus, e.g.
            * Construct comparative frequency lists of 2008 and 2016 speeches by Clinton, identify keywords, collocations and examined and interpret concordance listings
            * Apply approrpriate sentiment analysis techniques to Trump tweet corpus, cluster tweets by sentiment and time, examine distinctive words and phrases
            * Collocation analysis of topic related words (e.g. _poverty, poor, low-income_ or _immigration, immigrants, illegals, illegal aliens_)
            * Create n-gram frequency lists and compare collocations and patterns relating to _smoking_ and _vaping_
            * Examine and compare collocates of words for women between two genres
         4. Visualize data
            * Find appropriate ways to communicate the most important and relevant results from step 3. This might be use a frequency list, concordance listings, a scatter plot of words and phrases, etc. 
         5. Interpret findings
            * How does your text analysis answer your research question?
            * Why and how does it matter?
         6. Write up in a blog post 


            These steps will be scheduled throughout the course allowing for the instructor to help you find a manageable problem, acquire the necessary data and be able to carry out the appropriate computational analysis.
            
     * More details of the kinds of projects that would be appropriate and manageable will be discussed during the first few weeks of class.



## Note about learning programming

A central goal of this class is to help students begin to develop programming skills that they can use to approach questions of interest using the growing amounts of textual data available in the era of 'big data'. But like learning any new skill, such as a new language, it takes time and can be frustrating at first. This course does not require students to have any programming background. Realistically it is not possible to become a fully proficient programmer in just one semester. However, the lab sessions and assignments are focused on helping you begin this process and to become comfortable with reading, understanding and modifying Python code examples that you can find on the web etc.
